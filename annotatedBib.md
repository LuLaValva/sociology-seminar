# [@Wu_2019_MisinformationInSocialMedia]

In their work, @Wu_2019_MisinformationInSocialMedia examine misinformation in social media and discuss the potential for detecting it with machine learning algorithms. The issue they feel is most important is that the definition of misinformation varies wildly across current literature. It always describes information that is fake or inaccurate, but this definition is far too broad to be studied extensively. As such, they define eleven categories and subcategories of misinformation that can each be studied individually. Some important variables are brought up continuously, most frequently the intention of deceit and the verification of information.

After defining categories of misinformation, the researchers determine that they intend to focus on false information which is intentionally and maliciously spread in social networks. The two main types of attacks in social media are **manipulation of networks**, in which fake accounts will attach themselves to preexisting social networks or form their own, and **manipulation of content**, in which they copy large portions of information from real accounts and then introduce illegitimate information. They go on to discuss each of these types of attacks in detail and describe ways in which spam accounts can be automatically detected. Four methods of detection are proposed; an illegitimate post can be identified based on the contents of the post, the context in which it was posted, the patterns with which the post propagated throughout the platform, or before it becomes viral using a combination of these techniques. Misinformation in social media posts is often contextualized with very little supporting data or labels.
