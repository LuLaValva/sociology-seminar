# Abstract

The spread of misinformation and "fake news" in social media has been a major source of concern for a large number of vocal members of society in recent years. It is often stated that this problem has worsened as the internet has become a larger part of daily life due to the way that algorithms encourage _all_ information to spread, regardless of its reliability. This proposal addresses the causes of this algorithmic spread of misinformation and proposes an experiment that may be performed in order to learn more about a new method for its mitigation. In this new method, the idea will be explored that slowing the propagation of all news and information on social media may encourage users to naturally filter out unreliable sources. This hypothesis is backed by a large body of current research in internet-based misinformation.

# Introduction

Since the advent of the internet, communication among members of society has undergone a massive transformation. Gone are the days when information was expensive to share, so only the most important and potentially impactful news was condensed before it was shipped long distances. Most of humanity now belongs to a society in which any member has the power to reach every other person, regardless of distance and time. This has been a revolutionary improvement for countless individuals, as it is now nearly impossible to silence the voices of people who feel that they need to be heard. While this freedom is advantageous for workers who are mistreated and for whistleblowers who have important information which has been suppressed from the public, it is also extremely helpful for people who want to spread news or information with malicious political or capitalistic intent. Many professional news sources and academics have begun to wonder whether the freedom that the internet generates for people from all levels of education and walks of life to anonymously speak from the same podium has resulted in unintended negative consequences. The consequence that is most often discussed is the proliferation of "fake news" and other misinformation on the internet.

A very large body of politicians, news anchors, academics, and activists have been voicing negative opinions about rampant misinformation for many years, but public knowledge of the problem seems to have grown exponentially since the United States presidential election in 2016, as large political campaigns were built around the presence of "fake news" that has supposedly made its way into every tendril of mainstream media. Because of the large attention that this topic has received, social media companies and academic institutions alike are feverishly seeking methods that may be used to mitigate the problem. Hundreds of research papers are produced every year which study specific aspects of internet misinformation, such as the potential reasons why it is appealing to users of social media, the way that a topic propagates throughout the internet, and the detection of misleading news with the use of algorithms. One topic of discussion that seems not to have received as much attention is the way that algorithms encourage certain posts and bodies of information to spread.
