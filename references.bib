	abstract   = {The widespread dissemination of misinformation in social media has recently received a lot of attention in academia. While the problem of misinformation in social media has been intensively studied, there are seemingly different definitions for the same problem, and inconsistent results in different studies. In this survey, we aim to consolidate the observations, and investigate how an optimal method can be selected given specific conditions and contexts. To this end, we first introduce a definition for misinformation in social media and we examine the difference between misinformation detection and classic supervised learning. Second, we describe the diffusion of misinformation and introduce how spreaders propagate misinformation in social networks. Third, we explain characteristics of individual methods of misinformation detection, and provide commentary on their advantages and pitfalls. By reflecting applicability of different methods, we hope to enable the intensive research in this area to be conveniently reused in real-world applications and open up potential directions for future studies.},

	abstract  = {Truthfulness judgments are a fundamental step in the process of fighting misinformation, as they are crucial to train and evaluate classifiers that automatically distinguish true and false statements. Usually such judgments are made by experts, like journalists for political statements or medical doctors for medical statements. In this paper, we follow a different approach and rely on (non-expert) crowd workers. This of course leads to the following research question: Can crowdsourcing be reliably used to assess the truthfulness of information and to create large-scale labeled collections for information credibility systems? To address this issue, we present the results of an extensive study based on crowdsourcing: we collect thousands of truthfulness assessments over two datasets, and we compare expert judgments with crowd judgments, expressed on scales with various granularity levels. We also measure the political bias and the cognitive background of the workers, and quantify their effect on the reliability of the data provided by the crowd.},
