The internet has been deeply embedded in almost all parts of everyday life in the modern world, and it has drastically changed the way that people communicate and industries are run. As such, if a large-scale loss of internet is caused for any reason it is likely to have a drastic effect on society at large. There are not many occurrences of widespread internet disruption, so most research on the topic is scarce and speculative. This propsal addresses the lack of research on internet loss by expanding the body of knowledge in the academic world about the potential impacts of a widespread internet elimination on local businesses and their networks. In order to accomplish this, a research team will find small business owners across the continental United States and provide them with a qualitative survey.

# Introduction / Overview

Since its creation in the latter half of the twentieth century, the internet has spread through the world at an unprecedented, exponential rate. What started off as a simple tool for communication is now at the center of social interaction, business, education, supply chain management, medical instituations, and nearly every other industry. The global pandemic of 2020 only accelerated this spread, and studies have estimated that the average internet user accesses it for almost 7 hours every day [@kemp2021]. Industry is also increasingly dependent on the internet, as most factories and plants require internet access at all times to run at peak efficiency. Most institutions that use a large amount of data, such as research universities and hospitals, store it using a cloud provider and explore it using web requests. Most argue that this widespread adoption of the internet has been positive for many reasons; people have more access to information and knowledge than they ever have before, factories are able to run much more efficiently due to algorithmic optimizations, and institutions are able to share and iterate on ideas instantaneously from anywhere in the world. However, some have pointed out that as a society, we have "put all our eggs in the Internet basket" and are worried that if some situation leads to widespread loss of internet, it could be a disaster [@grandhi2020].

A total loss of internet for an extended period of time is not entirely out of the question. According to some scientists, we are overdue for a solar wind occurrence that could wipe out all electricity for an entire country. Space debris could cause a cascade of sattelite destruction which would lead to a worldwide loss of sattelite internet, and underwater animals or earthquakes could wipe out wired communication between the Americas and Eurasia. More predictably, governments at war or terrorist attacks are potentially capable of eliminating the internet using malware or with more conventional attacks to data centers [@sanger2019]. We have some examples of short-term internet elimination by governments and natural disasters and research has been published about the societal reaction to such events, but so far most of these occurrences have been in developing countries so it has not been possible to gather data about the first-world and western reaction to widespread internet disruption. As such, research on the topic is extremely minimal, and most publications on large-scale internet disruption are based on public opinion and speculation.

# Literature Review

## Frequency of Internet Use Today

Societal dependence on internet technologies has drastically increased every year, and statistical models have predicted that it is unlikely to slow down any time soon. According to the Pew Research Center, 93% of adults in America use the internet on a regular basis. This percentage is all but guaranteed to increase over time, as 99% of adults age 18-29 claim to regularly use the internet. As of 2021, 28% of young people have no connection to broadband and are instead entirely dependent on smartphone internet connectivity for long-distance communication [@pew2021]. In fact, the internet is so prevalent in society that @shandler2019 have proposed that it is necessary for our future as a society to reframe internet access as a human right. In this proposal, the authors share research showing that the entire political landscape has changed at a global scale as a result of emerging internet technologies, as citizens of almost all countries who did not have the means of sharing their voice were granted the ability to do so using social media and other internet communication technologies. True bottom-up democracy is now possible at a much larger scale than was ever even thought feasible a century ago. @kemp2021 shared statistics showing that the worldwide average amount of time that internet users spent on the internet per day was 6 hours and 54 minutes in 2020. This is an upward trend, and its speed is _increasing_ every year. 

Dependence on internet connectivity goes far beyond the realm of social media and human communication. With the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, the world's supply chain has become increasingly dependent on widespread connectivity to the internet. In their literature review, supply chain management researchers @bendaya2019 discussed various applications of these technologies and their role in modern infrastructure. The prevalence of these devices is startling, and it is without a doubt that a widespread outage of internet would be catastrophic for supply chains worldwide. None of this is to mention the significant use of business that are based entirely on internet access. In his report, @kemp2021 provided hundreds of statistics on general internet use in 2020 and 2021 in a digestable format. Kemp showed that about **three trillion** dollars were spent on items on the internet and through e-commerce sites worldwide in 2020.

## Previous Instances of Large-Scale Internet Disconnection

It is typically argued that the most prevalent cause of large-scale internet outages in the past has been intentional suppression by various governments of the world. In his analysis, @west2016 recalls a variety of instances in which politicians used their power to prevent citizens from accessing the internet. His findings highlighted the dependence that modern society has on internet technologies. In 2011, over a decade ago, internet use was not as prevalent as it is today. Even so, when the Egyptian government shut off the internet there for five days due to street protesters large swaths of the population were dramatically effected. Internet-based business such as e-commerce sites were not able to find any business in Egypt for nearly a week, and digital products that were not already downloaded or required internet access stopped functioning completely. Families were unable to communicate with each other. Schooling and education is dependent on the internet, so countless lesson plans were lost and assignments could not be turned in. Factories depend on data that is stored in the cloud to keep track of their inventory and keep their machines running, so productivity was lost countrywide. Hospitals often require the internet to access patient data, so it is often argued that lives were lost due to this outage. Overall, this political stunt resulted in ninety million dollars of reported costs and likely millions more that were unreported.

@west2016 highlighted that governments have continued to use their power to shut down the internet for their citizens in times of political unrest despite massive losses in GDP and public backlash. Between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016 there were 81 documented governmentally instructed internet shutdowns. The economic impact of these shutdowns is disputed, as it is difficult to determine losses that occurred specifically _because_ of the lack of internet. However, after an extensive cross-sectional analysis researchers were able to acquire a reasonable estimate of the monetary losses due to directed internet shutdowns. Overall, these decisions to shut down the internet were calculated to cost global GDP over two billion dollars between July of 2015 and 2016. This analysis had some limitations, however, and this number is likely much higher. There was no method that the researchers found to reliably calculate losses in worker productivity, lost tax revenue, or loss in confidence of investors, consumers, and businesses.

## Potential Causes for an Extended Outage

Governments have been shutting down the internet for their citizens in a totalitarian manner for over a decade, but most of these shutdowns have occurred in the developing world [@west2016]. These countries are less likely to have extensive disaster preparedness programs due to their developing nature and disaster preparedness programs are usually a part of the government, so disaster preparedness research is not likely to have a significant benefit to these situations. However, there are various other ways in which the internet may be lost for an extended period of time. @grandhi2020 highlighted reports from various news sources which stated that terrorist attacks have attempted to cause a widespread internet shutdown multiple times in the past. In addition, a New York Times report shared that the United States and Russia have each planted malware in the opposing country's infrastructure that is supposedly capable of shutting down power plants, pipelines for oil and gas, and water supplies [@sanger2019].

Internet Service Providers have incorporated excessive redundancy to prevent outages due to natural disasters, but they are not immune to disasters of a sufficiently large scale and less affluent countries are disproportionately effected. For example, in 2017 Hurricane Maria caused Puerto Rico to lose power and internet for an extended period of time [@florido2018]. It is also possible that a solar wind incident like the Carrington event of 1859 eliminates electricity and the internet across an entire continent for up to a year [@grandhi2020].

## Public Perception and Anticipation

Until a few years ago, there was a very limited body of academic knowledge regarding the general public opinion of large-scale internet outages. Recognizing this hole in literature, human-computer interaction researchers @grandhi2020 surveyed a large body of students and university faculty about their thoughts on a widespread loss of internet. At the beginning of the survey, the researchers acquired demographics and asked about the participants' thoughts about the likelihood of a total internet outage. One interesting demographic that the researchers asked for was the participants' self-evaluation of their frequency of social media usage. On a 7-point scale, where 1 refers to never and 7 to very frequently, they found that the average was 5.81. On average, participants were fairly frequent users of social media. They also found that participants were fairly weary of the possibility of an internet outage. While none of the 784 participants believed that a total internet outage is very likely, a majority of them thought it was possible or somewhat likely. Only about 7% of participants expected an internet outage to be entirely out of the question.

The rest of the survey was mostly qualitative, as participants were tasked with providing written responses to a set of general and undirected open-ended questions. After all of the surveys were completed, researchers combed through the responses and extracted overarching themes. After compiling results, they separated public opinion into two categories: Egocentric change (positive, negative, and neutral) and Societal Impact (positive, negative, and neutral). Most positive egocentric change that people shared was an optimistic outlook on the forceful removal of some of the generally accepted negative consequences of the internet, such as social media addiction and lack of face-to-face interaction. The negative changes were much more extreme, as people were concerned for their safety. In a situation where internet is lost, participants expect to lose access to their work and source of income, and change their entire livelihoods. One deaf participant also shared that they would lose their access to emergency services, because they cannot call 9-1-1 on a regular phone line. Other participants felt that a large outage wouldn't really effect their lives positively or negatively, but there would be a massive shift in the way that they went about their daily lives.

According to @grandhi2020, public opinions of societal impact are not very far from those of egocentric change. Positive opinions are reflections of known issues with internet dependence, such as social media bubbles and pressure on teenagers. On the other hand, expected negative impacts are catastrophic. People expect that supply chains would collapse, money would lose meaning as credit card purchases were no longer possible, and public transportation would likely cease. A long-term absence of internet, according to public opinion, would cause a societal collapse. These are useful findings, but there were some limitations to this study. Most participants were students and all were college educated, and the open-ended nature of the questions prevented researchers from exploring specific details. 

## Academic Knowledge of Internet and Technology Avoidance

Because there have not been many large-scale internet outages that have lasted for an extended period of time, especially with the amount of internet dependence that society has had since the mid-2010s, research on societal separation from internet is few and far between. However, there is a growing body of research on technology avoidance at the microscopic level as individuals voluntarily decide to detach themselves from the internet. In subsequent works, @baumer2015 and @baumer2016 explored the importance of studying voluntary internet and technology non-use before laying some groundwork for future studies on the topic. They begin by highlighting the imporance of a formalized definition for internet non-use, as this is not as observable and reportable as internet use. There exists groups like the lower class in third-world countries, which have been detached from technology for their entire lives and see no need (or means) to get themselves involved with it. Other groups, like the Amish, are known as "non-users" of the internet and technology but they have selectively started acquiring communication and information technologies as a part of their lifestyles. In the latter case, non-use is a constantly evolving process and a "continually negotiated practice" [@baumer2015].

In their second publication on the topic, @baumer2016 explored voluntary as well as involuntary technology non-use, and offered that there is often not a clear distinction between the two but instead a spectrum. In addition to actual inaccessibility of technology for capitalistic reasons or by means of disability leading to technology non-use, there is an argument to be made that social media and internet addiction may lead to involuntary technology _use_. Despite these pedantic adjustments, the researchers continued to highlight that internet non-use is a severely underresearched topic and it deserves more academic attention than it was receiving during the writing of the article.

@hargittai2007 provides an intersting analysis of people who have opted to avoid social networking services in spite of their internet competence. Though this research is outdated in its web technologies, its findings provided more evidence that social media had a negative effect on mental health, and that forceful removal from it often had positive outcomes to students. However, it also showed that isolation from social media has caused some unintended negative consequences such as lack of social interaction with friends and an inability to learn about social events. Hargittai's study was limited only to college students, and its scope was limited to separation social media instead of from the entire internet, so more research is required to learn about voluntary internet separation.

# Rationale / Contributions

Research in the area of large-scale internet disruption is extremely scarce, and not much has been learned about public opinion of the topic. @grandhi2020 did an excellent job of learning about societal dependence on internet technologies and the expectations of the general public about widespread loss of internet. However, the scope of this study was limited to educated individuals as all participants were either employees or students at a University, and questions were so open-ended that each participant provided answers about a subject that was unique to them. Since this was one of the first studies on its topic, this was an effective way of finding key themes that are common among public opinion. For future studies on the topic, it is beneficial to narrow down to a few specific key points of discussion from the study by @grandhi2020 and focus on learning more about them. As such, the research prospected by this proposal will have a strong focus on egocentric change in the realm of impact on lifestyle.

# Method and Design

The purpose of this study is to identify the impact that a widespread loss of internet would have on local businesses and their networks. In order to accomplish this, researchers will contact small business owners across the continental United States through phone call until a sample size of at least 50 has been acquired by means of voluntary involvement in the study. After each business owner agrees to participate in the study, they will be prompted to answer a set of questions about their internet dependence in a 3-question qualitative phone interview, lasting around 30 minutes.

## Contents of the Interview

> "What parts of your business are dependent upon the internet to work properly?"

\noindent This question has two purposes-- First, researchers will learn statistics about average proportions of businesses which are based on the internet to work. Second, and most imporantly, research participants will have time to think deeply about their company's internet dependence. It is likely that some participants will be surprised by the amount that their business uses internet connectivity.

> "On a scale of 1-7, how possible do you think it is that the United States will undergo a large-scale outage of internet within the next decade?"

\noindent This question is taken directly from the @grandhi2020 study. It is useful to expand the data that is currently known, and to verify results.

> "If there were to be a widespread internet disruption that lasted 5 days or longer, what would change about the way you ran your business?"

\noindent At this point in the interview, the the researcher is expected to direct each participant through a discussion of their business plan in the event of an internet catastrophe. It is expected that this will be the longest part of the discussion, as participants will have already thought about all of the areas that would be effected during their answer to the first prompt.

## Expectations for Results

If results from the @grandhi2020 study are generalizable it is expected that, after some thought, business owners will be surprised by the dependence that they have on internet technologies. Some participants of that study were terrified of going back to the days of internet-less communication and felt as though losing the internet would cause a massive loss of productivity. Local business owners are likely to agree with this speculation, and similar concerns will probably emerge from the interviews.

# Conclusion

Societal internet dependence has been growing exponentially since the emergence of consumer internet technologies, and it shows no signs of slowing down. As businesses have adopted practices that do not function properly without internet connectivity, the prospect of a large-scale internet disruption has become an increasing source of concern. However, since there have not been many occurrences of such an event in the western world it has been difficult for academic institutions to select it as a source of study. Therefore, there is a comparatively miniscule amount of published research on the topic.

The research requested by this proposal will function as an expansion of current literature on the topic of public opinion of widespread loss of internet. Local business owners are expected to help academic institutions further their collective knowledge of internet dependence, and inspire further studies on the subject.
